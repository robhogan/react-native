/**
 * `PanResponder` reconciles several touches into a single gesture. It makes
 * single-touch gestures resilient to extra touches, and can be used to
 * recognize simple multi-touch gestures.
 *
 * By default, `PanResponder` holds an `InteractionManager` handle to block
 * long-running JS events from interrupting active gestures.
 *
 * It provides a predictable wrapper of the responder handlers provided by the
 * [gesture responder system](docs/gesture-responder-system.html).
 * For each handler, it provides a new `gestureState` object alongside the
 * native event object:
 *
 * ```
 * onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => {}
 * ```
 *
 * A native event is a synthetic touch event with the following form:
 *
 *  - `nativeEvent`
 *      + `changedTouches` - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last event
 *      + `identifier` - The ID of the touch
 *      + `locationX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the element
 *      + `locationY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the element
 *      + `pageX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the root element
 *      + `pageY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root element
 *      + `target` - The node id of the element receiving the touch event
 *      + `timestamp` - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculation
 *      + `touches` - Array of all current touches on the screen
 *
 * A `gestureState` object has the following:
 *
 *  - `stateID` - ID of the gestureState- persisted as long as there at least
 *     one touch on screen
 *  - `moveX` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch
 *  - `moveY` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch
 *  - `x0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant
 *  - `y0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant
 *  - `dx` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started
 *  - `dy` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started
 *  - `vx` - current velocity of the gesture
 *  - `vy` - current velocity of the gesture
 *  - `numberActiveTouches` - Number of touches currently on screen
 *
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * ```
 *   componentWillMount: function() {
 *     this._panResponder = PanResponder.create({
 *       // Ask to be the responder:
 *       onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,
 *       onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,
 *       onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,
 *       onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,
 *
 *       onPanResponderGrant: (evt, gestureState) => {
 *         // The gesture has started. Show visual feedback so the user knows
 *         // what is happening!
 *
 *         // gestureState.d{x,y} will be set to zero now
 *       },
 *       onPanResponderMove: (evt, gestureState) => {
 *         // The most recent move distance is gestureState.move{X,Y}
 *
 *         // The accumulated gesture distance since becoming responder is
 *         // gestureState.d{x,y}
 *       },
 *       onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (evt, gestureState) => true,
 *       onPanResponderRelease: (evt, gestureState) => {
 *         // The user has released all touches while this view is the
 *         // responder. This typically means a gesture has succeeded
 *       },
 *       onPanResponderTerminate: (evt, gestureState) => {
 *         // Another component has become the responder, so this gesture
 *         // should be cancelled
 *       },
 *       onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (evt, gestureState) => {
 *         // Returns whether this component should block native components from becoming the JS
 *         // responder. Returns true by default. Is currently only supported on android.
 *         return true;
 *       },
 *     });
 *   },
 *
 *   render: function() {
 *     return (
 *       <View {...this._panResponder.panHandlers} />
 *     );
 *   },
 *
 * ```
